1. About
   The Network Intrusion Detection XAI project is designed to detect network intrusions (e.g., benign vs. malicious traffic) using a deep learning model and provide explainable insights into the model’s predictions. The system:

Accepts Input: Takes 20 network features (e.g., Avg Packet Size, Flow Bytes/s) via a user-friendly frontend.
Generates Predictions: Uses a pre-trained model to classify network traffic.
Explains Decisions: Applies XAI techniques (Integrated Gradients, LIME) to produce visualizations (heatmaps, bar plots, feature importance plots).
Summarizes Results: Integrates Google’s Gemini API to analyze visualizations and summarize key features.
Serves Visualizations: Delivers plots to the frontend for display.

The backend is built with Flask, handling model inference, XAI processing, and plot serving. The frontend, created with Next.js and Vercel v0, provides an interactive dashboard for input and result visualization. This project is ideal for cybersecurity researchers, data scientists, and developers interested in XAI and network security.

2. Backend
   The backend is a Flask application located in Backend/ that processes network features, runs XAI analyses, and serves results and plots.
   Features

Endpoints:
POST /predict: Accepts 20 network features, runs Integrated Gradients and LIME, calls Gemini API for a summary, and returns predictions, plot paths, and explanations.
GET /plots/<filename>: Serves XAI plot images (e.g., ig_heatmap_sample_0_class_Benign.png) from Backend/plots/.

XAI Techniques:
Integrated Gradients: Generates heatmaps for CNN branch and bar plots for LSTM branch.
LIME: Produces feature importance plots for individual predictions.

Gemini API: Analyzes XAI plots and summarizes influential features.
CORS: Configured to allow requests from the frontend (http://localhost:3000, http://192.168.56.1:3000).

Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:cd Backend

Create and activate a virtual environment (or use conda):conda create -n NidsXaiPy310 python=3.10
conda activate NidsXaiPy310

Install dependencies:pip install flask flask-cors numpy torch lime matplotlib python-dotenv

Set up the .env file with your Google API key:GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

Run the Flask app:python main.py

The server runs at http://localhost:5000.

Testing

Test the /predict endpoint with Postman:curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Avg Packet Size": 120.0, ...}'

Access a plot:curl http://localhost:5000/plots/ig_heatmap_sample_0_class_Benign.png

3. Frontend
   The frontend is a Next.js application located in network-intrusion-detection/, generated by Vercel v0. It provides a user interface to input network features, display XAI plots, and show Gemini summaries.
   Features

Interactive Dashboard: Built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, featuring:
A form for entering 20 network features.
Cards to display XAI plots (Integrated Gradients heatmap, bar plot, LIME explanation).
A text area for the Gemini API summary.

API Integration: Fetches data from the Flask backend (http://localhost:5000/predict) and loads plot images (http://localhost:5000/plots/...).
Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.

Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:cd network-intrusion-detection

Install Node.js (LTS) from nodejs.org if not installed.
Install pnpm (package manager):npm install -g pnpm

Install dependencies:pnpm install

Run the development server:pnpm run dev

The app runs at http://localhost:3000 or http://192.168.56.1:3000.

Testing

Open http://192.168.56.1:3000 (or http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
Submit features via the form and verify that plots and the summary load.
Check the browser console (F12) for fetch errors.

Deployment

Push to a GitHub repository:git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push origin main

Deploy to Vercel:npm install -g vercel
